I cant stress this enough (see item 2 for details).


This project was created for the purpose of creating a delay based plugin

Some issued to clarify.
[1]
- Vu Meters are still being tweeked, due to sample by sample reading.
  Some readings will not show current audio, rather samples in front.

- Audio can be clipped very easily due to their not being a limiter as of yet installed on the pluging 
  be aware that this plugin will Clip if not correctly set. Currently working on a feed forward limiter this will be implemented soon.
